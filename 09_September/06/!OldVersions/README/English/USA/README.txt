# 2023 September 6th

## Session skipped

I took the night off from my Motor World: Car Factory session on 2023, Wednesday, September 6th due to time issues, and being too tired to play. This is the fourth time to date. I will play again on 2023, Tuesday, September 7th. This break period is becoming increasingly common, and is justified, as long as I play the next day.
