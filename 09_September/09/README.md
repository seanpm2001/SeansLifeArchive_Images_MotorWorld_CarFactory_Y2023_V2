# 2023 September 9th

## Session skipped

I took the night off from my Modern Smurfs Village session on 2023, Saturday, September 9th due to time issues, and being too tired to play. This is the fifth time to date. I will play again on 2023, Sunday, September 10th. This break period is becoming increasingly common, and is justified, as long as I play the next day.
