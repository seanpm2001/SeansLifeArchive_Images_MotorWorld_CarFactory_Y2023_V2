# 2023 September 11th

## Session skipped

I took the night off from my Motor World: Car Factory session on 2023, Monday, September 11th due to time issues, and being too tired to play. This is the sixth time to date. I will play again on 2023, Tuesday, September 12th. This break period is becoming increasingly common, and is justified, as long as I play the next day.
