# 2023 September 13th

## Session skipped

I took the night off from my Motor World: Car Factory session on 2023, Wednesday, September 13th due to time issues, and being too tired to play. This is the seventh time to date. I will play again on 2023, Thursday, September 14th. This break period is becoming increasingly common, and is justified, as long as I play the next day.
